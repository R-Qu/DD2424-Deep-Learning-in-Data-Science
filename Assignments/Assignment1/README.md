To train and test a one layer network with multiple outputs to classify images from CIFAR-10 dataset by implementing mini-batch gradient descent applied to a cost function that computes cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix.

1. Download [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) to a folder named 'dataset'
2. Run A1.py
